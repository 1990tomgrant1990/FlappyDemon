FlappyDemon is a first attempt at PyCharm game as well as a first attempt at uploading onto github.

Many thanks to the many tutorials i turned to in learning how to use PyGame.

The artwork was all done by myself in Aseprite (Also a first attempt)

To use the code/play the game you will need to have PyGame installed.

I hope you enjoy :)
